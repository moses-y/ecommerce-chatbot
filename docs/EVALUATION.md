## Performance Metrics *(Update table)*

| Metric                  | Value   | Target | Status |
| :---------------------- | :------ | :----- | :----- |
| Response Time           | [Update]s | < 3s   | [Update] |
| Intent Accuracy (Test)  | [Update]% | > 90%  | [Update] |
| Order Lookup Success    | [Update]% | > 95%  | [Update] |
| Human Handoff Flow      | 100%    | 100%   | âœ…     |

## Recommendations for Improvement

1.  **Enhanced Order Tracking**: Integrate with shipping carrier APIs for real-time tracking details.
2.  **Multilingual Support**: Add capability to handle customer inquiries in multiple languages using Gemini's capabilities.
3.  **Personalization**: Incorporate customer purchase history (if available and secure) for more tailored responses.
4.  **Proactive Notifications**: Explore mechanisms to alert customers about potential delivery delays or issues (would require a different architecture).
5.  **Analytics Integration**: Log conversation intents and outcomes (anonymously) to identify common customer issues and improve bot responses or business processes.
6.  **Database Migrations**: Implement Alembic for managing database schema changes systematically.

## Conclusion *(Update conclusion)*
The e-commerce chatbot successfully meets its core objectives using Google Gemini, SQLAlchemy, and a modular agent architecture. It provides helpful responses for common inquiries and demonstrates a solid foundation for future enhancements. The Gradio interface offers a user-friendly way to interact with the bot.
